However, the search should be optimized: at each step of the search we try to extend some sequence of operations (as we did with backtracking for queens), and try all the one-step extensions in some order. To make search feasible, one should be careful about this order: the heuristic is to consider first the position that has a smaller \"distance\" to the desired position. Here the distance could be measured by the sum of distances between current and desirable positions of each piece. (The distance is measured by the number of moves needed to get from one position to the other; it is often called Manhattan distance.) My friend (Stanislav Shalunov) showed be a program of this type (using python tools for priority queues); it is much shorted (less that hundred lines instead of almost four hundred) than the program that uses the approach discussed earlier; it also gives solutions with much smaller number of moves (hundreds instead of thousands), but for some configuration it takes more time (due to the exponential nature of search algorithms in general)\n",
